If you are tasked with reviewing my code: Please, give me a little bit of grace. I had a car wreck 9/24/2024 when I was planning on
using the majority of the afternoon to complete a lot of the functionality. Professor has given me some extra time to complete things, so if you get to this repo,
please understand that it might not seem complete right away if you do your reviews early. Come back later in the weekend and take a look again,
and it should hopefully be more complete by then.
